 <h2><br><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#FFFF99" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Missing Neutrinos</FONT></h2>
	<p>
	<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">A thermonuclear reaction of the type assumed to be powering
	the Sun must emit a flood of electron-neutrinos. Nowhere near the requisite number of 
	these neutrinos have been found after thirty
	years of searching for them.&nbsp; A series of grandly expensive experiments have failed to find the necessary
	neutrino flux.</FONT>
	</p>
	<P><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Some solar neutrinos have indeed been observed - but </FONT>
	<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">only one-third </font>
	<FONT
	SIZE="2" COLOR="white" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">the number required</FONT></b><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white"
	FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> if the fusion reaction really is the main source of the Sun's energy production.&nbsp;
	These negative results from the neutrino experiments have resulted not in any re-examination of solar models.&nbsp;
	Rather, an intense theoretical effort to discover new properties that solar neutrinos 
	'must have' has
	occurred.&nbsp; As a result of this effort, it was announced (June 2001) by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
	(SNO) in Canada that neutrinos have mass and can change 'flavor'.&nbsp; This supposedly accounts for
	why they have not been fully observed previously.&nbsp; However, several important questions remain to be answered
	about the methodology that was used by the SNO researchers in arriving at 
	their conclusions.&nbsp; Of course, whether neutrinos actually do change 
	type or not has no bearing whatever on the validity of the Electric
	Sun model.&nbsp; The neutrino problem is a hurdle only for the standard fusion model.&nbsp; In the Electric Sun
	model there is no energy produced in the core - </FONT><B><I><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">radiant
	energy is released at the surface by electric arc discharge.
	</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;So, 
	there is no 'missing neutrino' problem for the electric Sun model. The 
	electron-nuetrinos that are observed are probably produced by fusion taking 
	place at the solar surface that produces heavy elements (other than hydrogen 
	and helium).</FONT><p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">For
decades the measured deficiency of electron-neutrinos has been
a continuing embarrassment for those who want to believe that the accepted H-He
fusion model of how the Sun produces its energy is correct.&nbsp; Because
this failure to observe the predicted neutrino flux clearly constitutes
falsification of this fusion model, there has been a great
effort to explain away the observed deficit.</font>
<h2>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">The Official Announcement</font></h2>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">In June
2001, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Ontario, Canada made an
announcement that was joyfully hailed by proponents of the accepted mainstream
fusion model.&nbsp; The complete official announcement can be
viewed <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/first_results/page00.html">
	here</a> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">.</font><p>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">As a
result of their interpretation of the data obtained from their experiment,
SNO researchers claim that the deficit does not lie with the fusion model,
but is due to the fact that neutrinos change from one flavor to another
on their way from the center of the Sun to Earth.&nbsp; </font> </p>
	<p>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">There are thought to be three flavors of neutrino:
electron-neutrinos, muon-neutrinos, and tau-neutrinos.</font> 
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;Some of these 
	flavors were not measurable by the previous experiments that were looking 
	for them. SNO researchers claim, on the basis of their experiment,
that the measurable neutrinos turn into previously non-measurable ones
enroute from the Sun's core. That 'oscillation', they say, explains the previously
measured shortage.</font>
	</p>
<h3>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica">Press Releases</font></h3>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">Press
releases were filled with pronouncements of confidence that the standard
fusion reaction is indeed alive and well at the core of the Sun.&nbsp;
There was, however, more rejoicing than factual information in most of
these releases.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica">Some examples:</font></h3>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">1."Physicists
have wrestled with the 'solar neutrino problem' since the early 1970s,
when experiments detected a shortfall of the particles coming from the
sun. The neutrino shortage meant either that theories describing the nuclear
furnace at the sun's core were wrong, or that something was happening to
the particles on their way to Earth.&nbsp; Monday's announcement demonstrates
with 99 percent confidence that it is the latter."</font>
<br><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">-&nbsp;
AP article appearing on line in The Nando Times of June 19, entitled "Physicists:
Neutrinos have some mass," by Matt Crenson.</font>
<blockquote><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;
What was the basis for the &#8220;99% confidence&#8221; figure?&nbsp; Was that a mathematically
derived number based on a statistical analysis - or was it just pulled
out of the blue &#8211; an example of unprofessional, non-scientific, hubris?</font></blockquote>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;2.
"The SNO detector has the capability to determine whether solar neutrinos
are changing their type en-route to Earth, thus providing answers to questions
about neutrino properties and solar energy generation." - http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/first_results/</font>
<blockquote><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">QUESTION:&nbsp;
How can the SNO team claim the ability to determine whether something happens
to neutrinos enroute from the Sun to Earth without making measurements
at the Sun (at the start of the journey) or somewhere along the route?
Or by making assumptions about how they started out?&nbsp; More on this
question below.</font></blockquote>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;3."SNO
appears to be measuring a rate expected for all types of neutrinos combined
but a decided deficit for the electron neutrino."&nbsp;&nbsp; http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap010710.html</font>
<blockquote><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">COMMENT:&nbsp;
This appears to be in complete contradiction with the official announcement
that states that the results of the only SNO experiment that can measure
all three flavors of neutrino will not be announced until a later time.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Analysis of the Official
Announcement</font></h2>
	<p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">The SNO observations were only made here on Earth.&nbsp;
No satellite observations were made anywhere along the path, certainly
not at its beginning where the neutrinos start their journey (inside the Sun).</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">QUESTION:
</font><font color="#99FF99">Consider
a freight train that goes from New York to Chicago.&nbsp; We live in Chicago
and are only able to observe the train as it arrives in Chicago.&nbsp;
It arrives with 4 freight cars, 2 tank cars, and 1 flat car.&nbsp; How
is it possible, no matter how sophisticated our method of observation,
for us to make any conclusions about whether freight cars, tank cars, or
flat cars have been added to or subtracted from the train at, say, Cleveland?&nbsp;
Moreover, how is it possible to say that freight cars have mysteriously
turned into tank cars or flat cars along the route somewhere?&nbsp; (And
do it with &#8220;99% confidence&#8221;?)</font></font></blockquote>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">The answer
must be that they are assuming they know the value of the neutrino flux leaving
the Sun.&nbsp; If so, this is an exercise in circular reasoning.&nbsp;
If they know what the solar neutrino flux leaving the Sun is, there is
no need for the experiment. The experiment adds nothing in the way of verification
of the assumption.&nbsp; It certainly does not explain the low value of
neutrino flux observed here on Earth, it only confirms it.</font>
<p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">The
logic used in drawing conclusions seems to be faulty in other ways as well.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica">A sentence from the
conclusion of the report</font></h3>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">In the
conclusion of the Sudbury report it states:</font>
<br><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">"Comparison
of the (neutrino) flux deduced from the ES reaction assuming no neutrino
oscillations, to that measured by the CC reaction can provide clear evidence
of flavor transformation without reference to solar model flux calculations.&nbsp;
If neutrinos from the Sun change into other active flavors, then CC flux
&lt; ES flux."</font>
<h3>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica">A logical analysis
of the last above sentence:</font></h3>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">Let:</font>
<br><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">(a)
= Neutrinos from the Sun change into other active flavors.</font>
<br><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">(b)
= Electron-neutrino flux measurement is less than the measurement that
includes electron-neutrinos and some of the other two types as well.</font>
<p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">The
sentence says:&nbsp; IF (a) is true, THEN (b) is true.&nbsp; No one can
disagree with that.</font>
<p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">But
they are implying: IF (b) is true, THEN (a) is true. (If the measurement
of the flux of electron-type neutrinos is less than the more inclusive
measurement that includes some of the other types, then neutrinos from
the Sun change flavor on their way to Earth.)</font>
<p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">That
is a logical non-sequitor.&nbsp; If the Sun is emitting all three types
of neutrinos, e+u+t, then any Earthbound experiment that measures only
e will always have a lower output than one that measures (for example)
e + 0.1u + 0.3t.&nbsp; Moreover, the report states that the CC measured
value (e type only) is "significantly smaller than the measurements by
[S. Fukuda in an earlier experiment]".&nbsp; So the electron neutrino flux
just measured by SNO is <i><b>even lower than previously reported levels</b></i>.&nbsp;
And it is possible that muon-neutrinos oscillate into electron-neutrinos.&nbsp;
And that presents a further complication to the SNO conclusions because
of the already extremely low value of measured electron-neutrino flux.</font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There have been other neutrino experiments 
	that have resulted in unclear answers about whether neutrinos 'oscillate' 
	into different types. The final report of the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino 
	Detector (LSND) experiment in 2001said their results strengthened previously 
	published, but controversial LSND results that provided evidence of neutrino 
	oscillation and mass.&nbsp; The LSND data, collected from 1993 to 1998, <i>
	suggested</i> that muon anti-neutrinos oscillate into electron 
	anti-neutrinos.&nbsp; However the MiniBooNE project results of 2007 reported
	<i>
	<b>no</b></i> mu-neutrino to electron-neutrino oscillations of the sort that 
	would explain the LSND result. MiniBooNE was designed specifically to look 
	for this, and has successfully ruled it out at 98% confidence level.&nbsp; 
	So it is now exceedingly doubtful that the long sought excuse for the solar 
	neutrino flux deficit has been found.</font></p>
<h2>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">A measurement that
can and should be made but was not</font></h2>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">It is
regrettable that the SNO results do not address several other pertinent
questions relative to the solar neutrino flux. For example, why does the
total flux seem to be a function of the sunspot cycle?&nbsp; Physicist
Wal Thornhill points this out in detail in his analysis of the neutrino
problem at his Holoscience web site.</font>
<br><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">Thornhill
points out that the Electric Sun model predicts that fluctuations in the
neutrino flux will be correlated with the level of electrical input to
the Sun &#8211; that is, with such measurable phenomena as sunspot numbers and solar wind activity. This 
	corrlation
has already been observed qualitatively. The standard solar model cannot
explain it.&nbsp; Neutrinos carry no electrical charge; therefore, the
usual 'hidden strange magnetic fields lurking beneath the Sun&#8217;s surface'
cannot be invoked to explain away a correlation between neutrino flux and
sunspot number if, indeed, that correlation is real.&nbsp; Any quantitative determination of a 
	relationship between
neutrino flux and sunspot number and/or solar wind intensity would absolutely
falsify the fusion model once and for all.&nbsp; And it would be further
	validation of the Electric Sun model.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">But it was not undertaken.</font><h2>
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Summary</font></h2>
	<font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">The high
decibel level of rejoicing contained in the SNO pronouncements is unprofessional.&nbsp;
It is a clue that should not be ignored.&nbsp; It stands in curious contrast
to the existence of errors in fundamental logic contained in the
report.&nbsp; The prime requirement in research is scientific objectivity.
And (given the paucity of actual data that was collected) there is substantial
reason to question to what extent a degree of wishful thinking went into
the announced conclusions of this report.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1 color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica">There
simply is no way that a measurement taken at only one end of a transmission
channel can reveal changes that have occurred farther up the channel.&nbsp;</font></b><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">
The only way such conclusions can be made is when observations have been
made at more than one place along the path!</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">
Further measurements (MiniBooNE 2007) have found no evidence to support the SNO 
2001 announcement.</font><p><font size=-1 color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica">Clearly,
although the fusion model is beloved by its advocates, an objective analysis of the Sudbury 
	and MiniBooNE experiments
reveal that the missing neutrino problem still remains very far from
being solved.&nbsp; And unless it is, the fusion model stands completely
falsified.</font>
